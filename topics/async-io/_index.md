# Async I/O

Concurrency models for handling I/O operations efficiently.

## Notes

- [Synchronous I/O](synchronous-io.md) - Blocking execution model
- [Asynchronous I/O](asynchronous-io.md) - Non-blocking single-threaded model
- [Multithreading](multithreading.md) - Concurrent execution with shared memory
- [Async I/O vs multithreading](async-vs-multithreading.md) - Comparison of
  approaches
