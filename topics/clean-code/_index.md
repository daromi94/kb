# Clean code

Principles and practices for writing maintainable, readable software.

## Notes

- [[wtfs-per-minute]] - Measuring code quality by cognitive friction
- [[triad-of-maintainability]] - Easy to read, understand, and modify
- [[abstraction]] - Hiding implementation to manage complexity
- [[indirection]] - Adding layers between requester and provider
- [[polymorphism]] - Many shapes through common interfaces
- [[shutdown-surgery]] - Safely decommissioning legacy systems
- [[law-of-demeter]] - Only talk to your immediate friends
- [[tell-dont-ask]] - Command objects, don't query their state
