# Clean code

Principles and practices for writing maintainable, readable software.

## Notes

- [WTFs per minute](wtfs-per-minute.md) - Measuring code quality by cognitive friction
- [Triad of maintainability](triad-of-maintainability.md) - Easy to read, understand, and modify
- [Abstraction](abstraction.md) - Hiding implementation to manage complexity
- [Indirection](indirection.md) - Adding layers between requester and provider
- [Polymorphism](polymorphism.md) - Many shapes through common interfaces
- [Shutdown surgery](shutdown-surgery.md) - Safely decommissioning legacy systems
- [Law of Demeter](law-of-demeter.md) - Only talk to your immediate friends
- [Tell, don't ask](tell-dont-ask.md) - Command objects, don't query their state
