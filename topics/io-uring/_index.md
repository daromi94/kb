# io_uring

Linux's high-performance asynchronous I/O interface using shared memory ring
buffers.

## Notes

- [io_uring](io-uring.md) - Architecture, lifecycle, and performance features
- [Shared memory](shared-memory.md) - IPC technique underlying the ring buffers
- [Zero copy](zero-copy.md) - Avoiding CPU data copying in I/O operations
- [Proactor vs reactor](proactor-vs-reactor.md) - Completion vs readiness models
