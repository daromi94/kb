# Latency

Fundamentals of latency measurement, physical constraints, and tradeoffs in
system design. Based on Pekka Enberg's work.

## Notes

- [Latency definition](latency-definition.md) - Time between cause and effect
- [Latency constants](latency-constants.md) - Speed of light at nano/micro/milli
  scales
- [Bandwidth and throughput](bandwidth-throughput.md) - Capacity vs actual flow
- [Latency-throughput tradeoff](latency-throughput-tradeoff.md) - Pipelining
  tension
- [Dennard scaling](dennard-scaling.md) - End of free performance, rise of
  multicore
