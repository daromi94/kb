# Networking Fundamentals

Core concepts underlying computer networks, from client-server architecture to
the OSI model.

## Notes

- [Client-Server Architecture](client-server.md) - The asymmetric model of
  service requesters and providers
- [Offloading](offloading.md) - Why servers handle expensive computation
- [RPC](rpc.md) - Remote Procedure Call and transparent network communication
- [OSI Model](osi-model.md) - The seven-layer communication framework
- [Encapsulation](encapsulation.md) - How data travels through protocol layers
- [Addressing](addressing.md) - IP vs MAC and host-to-host communication
